<h4>Structure and Approach</h4>

Including: decomposition in to functions, development of data
structures and declaration of them at the appropriate locations,
choice of parameters to functions, use of appropriate <tt>struct</tt>
and
<tt>typedef</tt> declarations, choice of algorithms or methods.

<h4>Program Execution</h4>
Including: compilation, execution on test data, output presentation
and readability.<br>
